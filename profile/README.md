## Hi there 👋

This organization is primarily operated for [my personal use](https://github.com/terasakisatoshi).

We engage in programming to visualize various mathematical things. Our support is aimed not only at those who wish to learn mathematics and other sciences, but also at those who have already mastered them, offering a fresh perspective. We refer to this endeavor as `Arith`.

While the materials we use may be simple, our future activities aim to elevate more advanced content into an art form. The virtual art gallery, where our creations will be showcased, will exist on the Internet, and we plan to utilize cloud computing resources to establish and maintain it.
